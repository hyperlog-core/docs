# Connecting with your code editor

Your score is affected by the way you use your code editor. This is why we have built extensions for your code editor, from which we track the kind of files you are interacting with. We respect your privacy and do not collect any information about the code itself.

We currently only have support for VS Code. In the future, we plan to expand our support to include every code editor.
