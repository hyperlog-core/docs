# Hyperlog

As a student, when you were in 10th standard, you were told, “Beta, complete 10th properly, your life will be set.” Lies. In the 12th standard, you were told “Beta, complete 12th, get a good college, and your life will be set.” Lies. Now that you are in engineering, it is a constant battle of depression, grades, and the worst of all, incessant worry about “Am I good enough to be placed in some company?” or “Will any company pick me?”

There is a massive boom in hiring in the tech industry. The packages that students get are through the roof. And many students are being placed at the highest paying roles like never seen before.

But let’s be honest here. Colleges teach things that have been outdated in the industry for the past five years. Most of the students don’t get placed because they don’t know what they are doing. They don’t know if they are eligible for a particular opportunity. They don’t know.

What if all this weren’t the case? Say the companies approached you because they know that you are skilled at your work. Isn’t that the dream?

This is where Hyperlog comes in. We have built a platform that automagically checks your skillset levels and assigns you an actionable score. As you grow as a software developer, we constantly keep you updated on your level. This is the same score that we have used in many companies to hire developers.
